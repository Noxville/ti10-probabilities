# The International 10 Probabilities Visualizer
Frontend (public view) for visualizing generated probabilities

Each prediction snapshot is generated from a 100k iteration Monte Carlo simulation and stored for visualization in this project.

Each match with an unknown outcome is simulated using an ensemble method of team ratings and data from datdota.com.
